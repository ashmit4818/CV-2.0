# CV-2.0
This is a new CV website created using HTML and Tailwind. Tailwind CSS is an open source CSS framework. The main feature of this library is that, unlike other CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, it does not provide predefined classes for elements such as buttons or tables. Instead, it creates a list of "utility" CSS classes that can be used to style each element by mixing and matching. It can be used to create a website and just minutes :) .
I used Formspree to collect the contact form data.
